This app is a service aimed at promoting healthy consumption habits and environmental protection at the same time by reducing dependence on delivery.

This app is a GPS distance-based calorie counting service aimed at reducing dependence on delivery.
We want to reduce dependence on delivery by explicitly showing consumers health, economic cost, and ESG three factors, and giving users a sense of accomplishment.

To do this, we first called the Google Maps API, region, country, and restaurant search API.

Next, based on your current location and selected location information, it provides information on the distance between two locations, calories burned when walking that distance, carbon consumption with or without a receptacle, and motorcycle carbon emissions over distance.

Based on this information, users can feel a sense of accomplishment by explicitly confirming through the app what value they have gained by visiting directly without using a delivery app.

We expect that this app will make a small contribution to reducing delivery dependence by encouraging direct visits by making users feel a sense of accomplishment.
